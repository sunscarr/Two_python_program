# Two_python_program


The way I wrote the second program was influenced by the first. I thought about writing the first program by just splitting the line and then getting the numbers to take the difference,
but then I realized that some of the numbers had '*' in them so I decided to use regular expression to only take ints/floats digits from the lines. 
My second program followed the same pattern where I only took digits using regular expression and found the difference. Therefore, it was influenced by the first.
